Tariff recommendation
We have at our disposal data on the behavior of customers who have already switched to these tariffs (from the course project "Statistical Data Analysis"). It is necessary to build a model for the classification problem, which will select the appropriate tariff. Data preprocessing is not required - you have already done it.

Build the model with the highest possible accuracy. To pass a project successfully, you need to bring the share of correct answers to at least 0.75. Check the accuracy on the test sample yourself.
