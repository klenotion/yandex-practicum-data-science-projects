Borrower Reliability Research
The customer is the credit department of the bank. It is necessary to figure out whether the marital status and the number of the client's children affect the fact that the loan is repaid on time. Input data from the bank - statistics on the solvency of clients.

The results of the study will be taken into account when building a credit scoring model - a special system that assesses the ability of a potential borrower to repay a loan to a bank.
